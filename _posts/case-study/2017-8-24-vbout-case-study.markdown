## Introduction 

Vbout is a digital marketing platform that optimize users’ customers journey for Digital Marketers. It is an all in one dashboard with easy integration system. My role was to research, prototype, design,code, lead and manage a product design roadmap and product strategy . I collaborated with marketers, engineers, sales people to launch this project.  

## Research & Planning Phase 

Vbout has validated the all in one marketing solution with an MVP release, at that stage the product has a low level design with a complex application to use. The business goals was to start targeting the early majority and crossing the chasm to reach a product market fit, Including being part of all demo calls and interviewing users to gather a lot of information but I wasn’t yet satisfied, The CEO & I had decided to put an easy to represent the product quickly and add a mandatory sequence and we’ve validated a few hypotheses.

After gathering the data we’ve created a strategy together and started to plan the design phase.

## Design Phase   
With the information we have we’ve decided to segment the product features into five main components, the main product has a main metrics and each component has its own metrics.
